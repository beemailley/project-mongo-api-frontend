# Project Mongo API

The project for this week was to create a RESTful API using mongoose, MOngoDB, MongoDB Compass, and MongoDB Atlas. The API needed to have at least two endpoints - one that would return an array of data, and one that was capable of returning a specific/single item. There was also the option to accept filters via query parameters which I included.

## The problem

I spent most of this week sick, so my main goals were to satisfy the requirements of the assignment. I relied heavily on replicating last project's functionality. However, I also spent a lot of time understanding MongoDB and incorporating mongoose. I chose to use data from Kaggle on Nintendo game releases from 1996-2021. I downloaded my data, and cleaned up the data set to make it more useable. When I began coding I wrote one endpoint at a time, testing it before moving to the next. Once my API was functioning, I deployed the backend, and began working on the frontend. I chose to use the frontend as a way to share the API documentation, and example data from different query values.

If I had more time, I would work on creating more endpoints and queries for my API
